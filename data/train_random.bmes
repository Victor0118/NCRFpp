insist O
Lebed O

that O
the O

took O
to O

had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin B-ORG

If I-ORG
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed O
suddenly O
found O
it B-ORG
necessary B-ORG
to I-ORG
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow O
. O

Lebed O
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O

who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O

want O
it O

would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov O
warned O
that O
Lebed O
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as B-PER
a B-PER
former B-PER
Russian B-PER
army O
commander O
in O
the O

who O
sought O
a O

blown O
up O
last O

Maskhadov O
may O

Lebed O

forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O

on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel B-PER

said O
the O

come O
close O

both I-ORG

Tactics O
used O
by O
some O
underground O
groups O
including O
the O
cryptic O
Berkshire O
Wood O
Elves O
, O
which O
distribute O
leaflets O

instructions O
on O
home-made O

now O
the O
subject O
of B-MISC
a B-MISC

include O
Earth O
First O
, B-PER
The B-PER
Land I-PER
is O
Ours O
, O
Alarm O
UK O
and O
Road O
Alert O
. O

The O
groups O
have O
targeted O
specific O
projects O
like O
the O
Newbury O

and O
the O
M3 O

through O
Twyford O
Down O
in O
the O
southern B-LOC
county B-LOC
of O
Hampshire O
. O

But O
they O
are O
also O
campaigning O
on O
broader O
issue O
such O
as O
stopping O
the O
government O
road B-PER
building B-PER
programme O
and O
out-of-town O
superstores O
which O
they O
say O
create O
more O
traffic O
, O
pollution O
and O
damage O
local O
communities O
. O

The O
government O
has O
slashed O
its O
road-building O
spending O
. O

Although O
protests O
may O
have O
contributed O
to O
the O
decision O
it O
has O
been O
seen O
primarily O
as O
economic O
rather O

ecological O

The O

the O
SEC O

of O

, O
Richard O
Lindsey O
, B-PER
said B-PER
Wall O

7 O

out O

called O
for O
by O
the B-MISC
new B-MISC

. O

In B-MISC
proposing B-MISC
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC O
noted O
that O
while O

improved B-PER

existed O
that O

It O
noted O
that O
customers O

lost O
the B-PER
chance B-PER
of I-PER
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O

. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of B-LOC
a B-LOC
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O

in O

, O
thus O

Earlier O

the O

The O
SEC O
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have B-PER
allowed B-PER

with O

The O

again O
. O

The O

also O
proposed O

The O
European O
Commission O
said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
would O
study O
scientific O
reports O
saying O
Britain O

mad B-LOC
cow B-LOC
epidemic O
would O
die O
out O
by O
2001 O
but O
offered O
little O
prospect O
the O
findings O
would B-MISC
change B-MISC
an B-LOC
agreed B-LOC
slaughter O
campaign O
. O

" O
Obviously O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
this O
research O

We O
will O
ask O
the O

EU O

scientific O
and O
veterinary O
committee O
to O
examine O
it O
, O
" O
Commission O
spokesman O
Gerard O

told O

But O
he B-LOC
added B-LOC
that O
new O

the O

of O
the O
bovine O
spongiform O

( O
BSE B-ORG
) B-ORG

agreed O
by O
Britain O

its O
14 B-MISC
EU B-MISC
partners I-MISC
. I-MISC

" O
We O
agreed O
that O
following O

which O
would B-MISC
take B-MISC
out O
the O
maximum O
number O

possible B-LOC
. O

I O
think B-MISC
it B-MISC
would I-MISC
be O
very O
difficult B-LOC
to B-LOC
sell O
to O
the O
European O
Commission O
a O
programme O
which O
would O
involve O
the O
elimination O
of O
fewer O

cases O
, O
" O
Kiely O
said O
. O

" O
We B-PER
will B-PER
look O
at O
our O
approach O
( O

we O
wo O

" O
he O

" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O
the O

, O
that O

not B-LOC
the I-LOC
issue O

the O

the O
rapid O

, O
" O
he O
added O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British O
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford O
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature O
saying O
it B-ORG
would B-ORG
be O
hard O
to O

2001 B-PER

The B-MISC

" B-PER

now O

National O

Naish O
said O
there O
was O
no O

carry O
out O
a O

of O
some O
147,000 O

it O

placate B-PER
its B-PER
European I-PER

. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence B-PER
to B-PER
me I-PER
means O
some O
of O
that O

should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O

this B-LOC
evidence B-LOC
, O
" O
Naish O
said O

The O
report O
could O
well O
reopen O

which O
slapped O
a O

there O
could O
be O
a O

between O

he O

" O
I O

our O

at O

that O

probably B-MISC

" O

" O
It O

" B-PER
I B-PER

the O

" B-ORG
I O

the B-PER

the O

that O

" O
Under O

the O

certainly O
looked O
for O

" O

That O

the B-PER
architect O
of O
the O

comeback O

" O
Rubin B-LOC
has B-LOC
done I-LOC

Fear O
that O
a O

might O
favour O
a B-ORG
return B-ORG

Bentsen-era B-PER
policy B-PER

spell O

As O
for O

, O
Widness B-MISC
explained B-MISC
that O
Alan O

reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the B-MISC
Federal B-MISC
Reserve I-MISC
and O
the O
outlook O
for O
the O

were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin O
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury O
. O

" O
Although O
, B-LOC
if B-LOC
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O

depreciation B-PER
, B-PER
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O

the O
United O

" O
said O

adding O
that O
could O
hurt B-MISC
U.S. B-MISC

to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin B-MISC

because O
the O
firm O

yielded O
positive O
results B-MISC

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any B-PER
