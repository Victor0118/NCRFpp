Van O

the O
tough O
competition O
had O
prevented O
Zywiec O
from B-LOC
raising B-LOC
prices O

The O
British O

warned O
Friday O
that O
it O
would O
refer O
the O
proposed O
trans-Atlantic O

Industry O
Secretary O
Ian O
Lang O
added O
that O
even O
if O
the O
conditions O
were B-LOC
met B-LOC
by O
both O
airlines O
, O
final O
clearance O
would O
hinge O
on O
an O
open O
skies O
deal O
between O
Britain O
and O
the O
United O
States O
to O
liberalise O
trans-Atlantic O
air O

, O
which O
would O
create O
greater B-MISC

on O

Lang O

he O
supported O
conditions O
proposed O
by O
Britain O

Office O
of O
Fair O
Trading O
, O
which O
was O
asked O
to O
examine O
the O

last O
month O
. O

" O
I O
agree O
... O
that B-ORG
without B-ORG
suitable I-ORG
undertakings O
the O

would O
be O
likely O
to O
lead O
to O
a O

Industry O

said O
there O
was O
no O
new O
date O
for O
fresh O

blamed O
the O
deadlock O
on O
uncertainty O
over O
whether O
the O
British O

would O
be O
cleared B-LOC
. B-LOC

The O
conditions O
for O

of O
the O

were O
that O
British O

However O

it O

" O
more O

" O
than O
those O
imposed O
by O
other O
regulatory O
authorities O
on O
similar O
airline O

. O

British O
Airways O
's O
initial O
response O
was O
that O
" O
unconditional O
divestiture O
of B-PER

is I-PER
unprecedented O
and O
if O
done O
it O
must O
be O

Laurent O

the O

told O

the O
crisis O

over O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Rwandan O

already B-ORG

do O
not O

Kinshasa O
opposes B-PER

Canadian O

" O

as O
though O
they O
( O

going O

General O
